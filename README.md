# Future Scope and Limitations
The proposed project is just a very basic database to store and display donor and volunteer 
information. There are several limitations in this project:
1. The interface is not graphical.
2. The reports generated have limited information.
3. There is no means of user authentication and no provision of data security.
4. All data is stored and can be accessed locally.
5. There is no provision of optimizing volunteer engagement based on hours/ location.
The scope of this project is immense and can be extended in several ways:
1. A user-friendly GUI can be designed for easy access. 
2. Email notifications can be sent to donors automatically when they make a donation.
3. Calendar integration can be done volunteers to sign up for specific volunteer 
opportunities on a calendar.
4. Donation tracking can be done over time and visualizations can be created.
5. Volunteer scheduling can be done helps nonprofits manage volunteer shifts.
6. donation statistics (e.g., total donations, donations by purpose) reports can be 
generated
7. Volunteer activities (e.g., hours volunteered, upcoming events) report can be created.
8. The application can be deployed on a server or cloud platform so that it can be 
accessed by school staff, donors, and volunteers.
9. Security measures may be implemented.
10. A user documentation and administrator guide for using and maintaining the system
may be created.
# Conclusion
The Donor and Volunteer Management System for Underprivileged Schools is a project that 
addresses a critical need in underprivileged communities. Connecting donors and volunteers 
with schools in need contributes to improving education and well-being of underprivileged 
students while fostering a sense of community involvement and social responsibility.
